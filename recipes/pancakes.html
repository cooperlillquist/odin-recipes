    <h2> Recipe Description</h2>
        <p>These simple from-scratch pancakes use ingredients you likely 
            have on hand—like all-purpose flour, baking powder, sugar, 
            butter, and egg—and it tastes so much better than boxed mix versions.</p>
        

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
            <ul>

                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup milk</li> 
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>

                <li>For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet, using the back of the spoon 
                    to spread batter into a round (you should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).</li>
